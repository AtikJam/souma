, 40-grain bullet is rated at a very hot 2,460 fps , and it's the flattest shooting of any revolver cartridge , with a mid-range rise of about an inch over a 100-yard range . This is a varmint load , pure and simple ; ; it's much too explosive for small edible game . It can cut a red squirrel neatly in two or burst a crow into a flurry of feathers . The most intriguing aspect of the S & W Magnum chambered for the new Jet is that it can also fire standard rim-fires by means of adapter sleeves in the chambers . You may therefore convert the gun into a small-game and plinking arm , although the difference in the point of impact ( Jet vs. rim-fire ) can be somewhat disconcerting . The accuracy of the Jet cartridge is fine ; ; I tested it in my scoped S & W and it was good enough to allow me to hit a chuck with every shot at 100 yards if I did my part by holding the handgun steadily .

Prokofieff's Classical Symphony was hailed as an ingenious work from a naturally gifted and well-trained musician still in his twenties . To the Traditionalists , it was a brilliant satire on modernism ; ; to the Neo-Classicists , it was a challenge to the pre-war world . What was it to Prokofieff ? ? A tongue-in-cheek stylization of 18th-Century ideas ; ; a trial balloon to test the aesthetic climate of the times ; ; a brilliant piece de resistance ? ? Certainly its composer was an ascending star on a new world horizon . I heard the Classical Symphony for the first time when Koussevitzky conducted it in Paris in 1927 . All musical Paris was there . Some musicians were enthusiastic , some skeptical . I myself was one of the skeptics ( 35 years ago ) . I remember Ernest Bloch in the foyer , shouting in his high-pitched voice : `` it may be a tour de force , mais mon Dieu , can anyone take this music seriously '' ? ? The answer is , `` Yes '' ! ! Certainly , America took Prokofieff and his Classical Symphony seriously , and with a good deal of pleasure . His life-long friend , Serge Koussevitzky , gave unreservedly of his praise and brilliant performances in Boston , New York , and Washington , D.C. , , to which he added broadcastings and recordings for the whole nation . Chicago was also a welcome host : there , in 1921 , Prokofieff conducted the world premiere of the Love For Three Oranges , and played the first performance of his Third Piano Concerto . `` Uncle Sam '' was , indeed , a rich uncle to Prokofieff , in those opulent , post-war victory years of peace and prosperity , bold speculations and extravaganzas , enjoyment and pleasure : `` The Golden Twenties '' . We attended the premieres of his concertos , symphonies , and suites ; ; we studied , taught , and performed his piano sonatas , chamber music , gavottes , and marches ; ; we bought his records and played them in our schools and universities . We unanimously agreed that Prokofieff had won his rights as a world citizen to the first ranks of Twentieth-Century Composers .

Shade trees , too , are a big help , so keep them if you can . Drawn blinds and draperies do some good , but not nearly as much as shading devices on the outside of the house . The more directly the sun strikes walls and roof , the greater its heat impact . The way a house is set on its lot can therefore influence how much cooling you're going to need . A shift in the walls , or a change in the roof slope , so the sun hits them more obliquely , can save you money . You can use heat-absorbing glass to stop the sun , double glass and insulated glass to combat condensation . Restrict large glass areas to the north and south sides of the house . They're easier to shade there . An attic space above insulation makes a house easier to cool . You'll even gain by putting your water heater outside the conditioned space , and using an electric range instead of a gas one . Gas adds to the moisture load .

No friends are to arrive without an invitation or without at least telephoning beforehand . No ringers , either -- even if they are trailing legitimate invitees . We want to know when the Potlatches telephone exactly how many they are planning to bring , so that we won't end up with a splashing mob that looks like Coney Island in August . No young children may come without adults except for a specific , organized , chaperoned party . And accompanying adults are urged to keep an alert and sensible eye on their responsibilities . A gaggle of gabbling mothers , backs to the pool , is no safeguard .

The most intriguing aspect of the S & W Magnum chambered for the new Jet is that it can also fire standard rim-fires by means of adapter sleeves in the chambers . You may therefore convert the gun into a small-game and plinking arm , although the difference in the point of impact ( Jet vs. rim-fire ) can be somewhat disconcerting . The accuracy of the Jet cartridge is fine ; ; I tested it in my scoped S & W and it was good enough to allow me to hit a chuck with every shot at 100 yards if I did my part by holding the handgun steadily . Hunting rifles , '61 The fact that the Deerstalker and the Jet were the only completely new designs this year doesn't mean that 1961 didn't see changes in models , actions and calibers . Aside from the Ruger carbine , a number of hunting rifles have been introduced for the first time . Here are the brands ( in alphabetical order ) and the new models .

The champagne at Troyes , the traditional capital of the champagne country , has more ambrosial taste somehow than it has at a sidewalk cafe on the Rue de la Paix or at Tour D'Argent . You can relive history and follow , in fancy , the Crusaders in their quest for the Holy Grail as they sail out from Brindisi , an ancient town in the heel of Italy's boot . And you don't meet the folks from home in Northwest Spain which has remained almost untouched by time and tourists since the Middle Ages . Time stands still as you climb the narrow , stone stairways in tiny villages clinging to steep mountain slopes or wander through story-book towns , perched atop lofty crags , their faces turned to the sea . They've been there since the days of the Moors and the Saracens . And what better way to end a day than by dining with artists and gourmets in a squat but charming fisherman's village on the Mediterranean ? ? An almost too-simple-to-be-true way to set forth on such adventures is just to put yourself behind the wheel of a car and head for the open road . For those who need or want and can afford another car , buying one and driving it on the grand tour , then shipping it home , is one popular plan for a do-it-yourself pilgrimage . Then , of course , there are those of us who either do not want or need or cannot afford another car . The answer to this diathesis is to pick up a telephone and arrange to rent one . It is that elemental .

There comes a time in the lives of most of us when we want to be alone . Not necessarily to be off all by ourselves , but away from the crowds and common happenstance . If you've travelled in Europe a time or two , it is quite certain that you've had that wanting-to-be-alone feeling or that you will get it on your next visit across the Atlantic . Following a guide , and gratefully so , is an excellent way to see all the important places when everything is strange and new . However , after you've seen all the historical piazzas and plazas , the places and forums , the churches and museums , the palaces and castles , and begin to feel at home in the capitals of Europe , you'll want to change your course and follow the by-roads at will , far from the market places . The champagne at Troyes , the traditional capital of the champagne country , has more ambrosial taste somehow than it has at a sidewalk cafe on the Rue de la Paix or at Tour D'Argent . You can relive history and follow , in fancy , the Crusaders in their quest for the Holy Grail as they sail out from Brindisi , an ancient town in the heel of Italy's boot .

Your invitation to write about Serge Prokofieff to honor his 70th Anniversary for the April issue of Sovietskaya Muzyka is accepted with pleasure , because I admire the music of Prokofieff ; ; and with sober purpose , because the development of Prokofieff personifies , in many ways , the course of music in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics . The Serge Prokofieff whom we knew in the United States of America was gay , witty , mercurial , full of pranks and bonheur -- and very capable as a professional musician . These qualities endeared him to both the musicians and the social-economic haute monde which supported the concert world of the post-World War 1 , era .

The placement of your pool , however , will not of itself solve the two major problems of pool owning -- those that involve your social life and those pertaining to safety . Coping with them demands stern discipline -- of yourself as well as of your family , neighbors , friends and anyone you ever talked to on a transoceanic jet . Eight years ago while we were going through the mud-sweat-and-tears construction period , we were each solaced by the vision of early morning dips and evening home-comings to a cool family collected around the pool with a buffet table laid out nearby for the lord and master's delectation . But not even our first pool-side gatherings came anywhere near those rosy fantasies . We seemed to be witnessing the population explosion right in our own backyards . Our respective families looked as if they had quadrupled . Had we taken a lien on a state park ? ? Not at all . We had merely been discovered by the pool sharks . We were in business ! ! From proud pool-owners to perpetual hosts and handymen was a short step -- no more than the change from city clothes to trunks . Naive of us , maybe , but the results of our impulsive invitations to `` come over next summer and swim in our new pool '' were both unexpected and unsettling .

Another spot with an image-provoking name is the Black Hills where you can visit the old frontier mining town of Deadwood . The Black Hills Passion Play is produced every summer and is a pageant worth seeing and shooting . Of course , while in this vicinity you won't want to miss a visit to Mount Rushmore National Memorial where on the side of a mountain are the famous sculptures of Presidents Washington , Lincoln , Jefferson and Theodore Roosevelt . In Missouri ( which we are including in our general Midwest region ) you can glance into Mark Twain's birthplace at Hannibal , see the landmarks of his life and writings and visualize where Huck Finn hatched his boyish mischief .

Minnesota , fabled land of waters , is in itself , ideal vacationland , having within its borders 10,000 lakes ! ! Itasca State Park , where the Mississippi River begins , is one of the outstanding tourist spots in Minnesota . Mementoes of the Old West recall the days of Wyatt Earp in Dodge City , Nebraska , where present-day cowboys add a colorful human interest note to your vacation shooting .

In the grand court of the Palace , notable for its tiers of Moorish galleries that looked down on the maelstrom of vehicles below , Vernon's station was at the entrance . It was a post of honor , held inviolate for him ; ; he had the primacy among the coachmen . Of majestic build , rubicund and slash-mouthed , he resembled the late General Winfield Scott , who was said to be the most imposing general of his century , if not of all centuries . Vernon wore a gray tall hat , a gardenia , and maroon Wellington boots that glistened like currant jelly . Promptly at seven he would clatter out of the court with twelve in the tallyho . He had style : he held his reins in a loose bunch at the third button of his checked Epsom surtout , and when the horses leaned at a curve , as if bent by the force of a gale , he leaned with them . They cantered down the peninsula , not slackening until the coach reached Woodside where the Santa Cruz uplands begin . The road maps of the region have changed since 1905 ; ; inns have burned down , moved elsewhere , or taken other names . Once on the road ( and especially if the passengers were all regulars and masculine ) , the schedule meant nothing . An agreeable ease suffused Vernon and the passengers of the tallyho , from which there issued clouds of smoke . Vernon would tilt his hat over one ear as he lounged with his feet on the dashboard , indulging in a huge cigar . The horses moved at a clump ; ; they were no more on parade than was their driver ; ; one fork of the road was as good as another . The Santa Cruz mountains sprawl over three counties , and the roads twist through sky-tapping redwoods down whose furrowed columns ripple streams of rain , even when heat bakes the Santa Clara valley below at the left . The water splashes into shoulder-high tracts of fernery . You arrive there in seersucker , and feel you were half-witted not to bring a mackintosh .
